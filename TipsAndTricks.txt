- KouChat v1.1.0 Tips & tricks

Become a KouChat power user with these tips & tricks :) 


1. Minimize with escape 

The main chat window can be minimized to the system tray by pressing escape.
The private chat window can be hidden by pressing escape. 


2. Learn hotkeys 

Several of the most used functions have hotkeys. Look in the menus to see which. 


3. Autocomplete nick names 

Instead of writing hello SuPeRmAn (if the user is called SuPeRmAn),
you write hello s and press the tab button. The rest of the nick name will
be filled in. If more than one user has a nick name starting with s then
press tab multiple times to cycle through all the choices. Or write more of
the nick name before pressing tab again. The autocompletion is case insensitive. 


4. Drag and drop files to send 

If you want to send a file to a user, just drag the file on to the user in
the user list. Or if you are in a private chat, then drop the file in the
private chat window. 


5. Use the history 

The last messages you wrote are saved in a history list (only in memory).
Press the up and down arrow buttons when the input text field has focus to
navigate through the history. 


6. Click on links 

When URLs are written in the chat, they are made into links. Click on a link
to open the URL in your browser. Which browser can be changed in the settings. 


7. Double click to chat private 

Double click on any user in the user list to start a private chat with
that user.
