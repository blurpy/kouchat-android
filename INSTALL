- KouChat Android INSTALL

KouChat is built with Gradle.

Use './gradlew clean test lint assembleDebug' to create an installable debug .apk in the app/build/outputs/apk folder.

To create a signed release .apk you need to configure a keystore.
Update gradle.properties with valid values and build using './gradlew clean build'.
